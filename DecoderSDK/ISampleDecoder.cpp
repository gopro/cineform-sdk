/*! @file ISampleDecoder.cpp

	@brief Interface for the sample decoder class.

	This class is used internally by CineForm software and is not currently
	mentioned in the documentation provided to customers.  Modify this comment
	and add tags for Doxygen to publish this interface in customer documentation.

	The interface uses pure virtual methods to isolate applications that use the
	CineForm decoder from changes to the codec library.  The interface includes
	macros (methods defined in the class declaration) for common calculations
	involving pixel formats.
